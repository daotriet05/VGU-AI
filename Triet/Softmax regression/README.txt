MODEL
	- Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb
		- built following the instruction with small personal changes
	- Credit Card Fraud Detection improved.ipynb
		- built from Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb
		- due to the Skewed dataset (only 0.02% of all the samples is positive)
			- modify dataset by deleting negative samples
			- the ratio between positive and negative samples is 1:2
		- try Neuron Network to test does it make the performance better
			- the result looks like not much different
	- Twitter Sentiment Analysis.ipynb
		- built following the instruction with small personal changes
			- the accuracy is very low (<45%) and the model has reached the limit and cannot improve any more (the loss stays at around 34-36% for 200 epochs)
		- built by Neuron Network
			- 4 Dense layers (128 units, 64 units, 32 units and 3 units)
			- added EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting
			- the accuracy reached to 90% after 88/200 epochs (stopped by EarlyStopping)
